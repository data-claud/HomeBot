This repo wants to be a quick guide to build a easy chatbot via telegram. This chatbot is based on Node-Red and so in NodeJs to wrap over the complexity of Apis to build a bot in less than 15 minutes

To simplify the bot deploy, we have build a virtual machine with all the requirements fulfilled. You can download the image here: https://goo.gl/mRxkny

We hope that you can learn how a bot can be built without a single line of code using Node-Red and some community packages.

Good luck!
